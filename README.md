#Image Converter 
I needed to convert several images by ether width or height a few times 
and I got tired of doing it by hand. 

There are probably a lot of different converter created already
but I just wrote one more just because I never have written one in Java.

For now this converter is using Thumbnailator because converting images with good quality
is not that easy in Java and Thumbnailator did good enough job for my purpose.
